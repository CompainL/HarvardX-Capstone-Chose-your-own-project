# HarvardX-Capstone-Chose-your-own-project
My submission for the last course of the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate. 

This is a choose-your-own project and I decided to use the Kaggle OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data.

My goal was to predict how long a patient's symptoms would last based on the information available about the patient.

Please take note that this is a theoretical exercise and in no way should be used in a real medical context.
